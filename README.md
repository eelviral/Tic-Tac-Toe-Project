The repository does not currently have an executable that runs the program. It can only be accessed by a Java compiler that uses JDK version 1.2 or higher. If your compiler or IDE meets these conditions, you may access `TicTacToeGame.java` and use the following commands to compile and run it:

Compile:

## Motivation

This program was originally developed as part of a school project. I created this repository to demonstrate previous experience with Java, and I plan to use this experience to develop more complex software with Java in the future.
